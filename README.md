<p>This app provides a crude calculation of the probability that someone matching certain demographic characteristics will die in the next year. This calculation has only two parts: A numerator representing how many people with the above demographic characteristics have died in the years 2009-2014, and a denominator representing an imputed estimate of how many such people there were in the United States in the years 2009-2014. The data that calculates the numerator comes from <a href=http://www.nber.org/mortality/ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/>CDC</a>, and the data that computes the denominator comes from <a href=https://usa.ipums.org/usa/>IPUMS</a>. The number of deaths reported in the CDC data are disaggregated by <a href=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10.htm>ICD-10 cause-of-death code</a> for some plots. I use the unweighted IPUMS data in the denominator. Improvements will be made as suggested. The IPUMS sample age max is 96, while the maximum age value in the CDC data is 115. As such, for most plots, I truncate the data at 96. For both datasets, I use their annual files covering the years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.</p>

<p>Why is your probability of dying so low? This project is based on the sadly now-defunct Death Risk Rankings project based in Carnegie Mellon's Social and Decision Sciences department which found that, among other things, your probability of dying does not cross 0.5 until age... wait for it... 107! Dying is a less likely occurrence for you than you probably think. They used a different (and more involved) approach to calculating their denominator than I did, as I only want to give an impressionistic view of the most important points of an exercise like this: You are very unlikely to die, you will probably die of something other than what you think you'll die of, and people of different backgrounds have very different life experiences than you. Play around and observe how the relative risks change, over lifetime and across groups.</p>
